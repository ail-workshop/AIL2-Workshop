              Our sense of agency and ability to distinguish between intentional and accidental actions are fundamental for social interaction. They allow us to plan and perform joint actions and assign responsibility for our own actions and those of others. Research on the nature of agency and intentions has been very fruitful over the last few decades in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology. However, interdisciplinary discussion has rarely taken place. 
             <p>
		  The first interdisciplinary workshop on Agency and Intentions in Language was held at the start of 2021, and it was marked with great success. To continue the conversation, the second annual workshop will bring together scholars in linguistics, philosophy, and psychology interested in questions related to agency and intentions, broadly construed. Please consider submitting your work (details below), or attending the workshop, to advance the scholarly understanding of ideas central to multiple academic disciplines. 
		   <p>
		  On the linguistic side, we welcome submissions examining any grammatical phenomena sensitive to the degree of agency or interpretation of an action as intentional versus accidental, such as controller choice, subjunctive obviation, licensing of polarity items, aspect choice in Slavic, case marking in ergative split languages and ‘out-of-control’ morphology. Submissions are welcome from all domains of grammar (morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, etc.) and irrespective of any specific theoretical framework or empirical approach. Some of the topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following: 
		  </p>
            <ul id="speakers" >
              <li>
                ways in which natural languages manifest different degrees of agency or the distinction between intentional and accidental actions (morphological marking, syntactic structures, semantic denotations of verbs and adverbials, pragmatic and contextual differences)
            </li>
            <li>
              connection between agency, intentions, and event structure
            </li>
            <li>
              relation between agency, intentions, and causality
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On the side of philosophy, we welcome submissions addressing any aspect related to philosophy of action, philosophy of mind, the nature of agency, intentions, and acting intentionally. Both theoretical and empirical research are welcome as they contribute to debates on various theories of action, free will, moral responsibility, nature of reasons, and practical rationality.
          <p>
            Lastly, we are making an effort to include research in psychology that similarly deals with agency, intentions, moral responsibility, and other related topics, broadly construed.
